daBeerList
=====================
A starter project by me

## Project Details
This project uses the ionic framework. 

Originally, the app was scaffold in yeoman, I am now working on moving it to ionic. So some of the current code isn't working, but is there.

## TODO
-initial scafolding of app
	- create a new header
	- create a new add beer item to list
	- create edit screen
	- create a edit screen

-change up some behaviors, to use tools from the ionic framework(via angular)

-find a better way to manage storage(orginally used modernizr.localstorage)
